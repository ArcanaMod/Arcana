Similarly, when a block attempts to draw vis, it's drawn from connected blocks instantly. The blocks chosen to insert to, or draw aspects from, are arbitrary.\n\nThere are two variants of the essentia pipe: the aspect window and the aspect valve. The aspect window shows the last type of aspect that passed through it for some time, and the aspect valve can be opened and closed by clicking.\n\nRedstone force-closes a valve, and a window pipe emits a comparator signal while displaying an aspect.",

But inspiration comes when you least expect it, like the old saying goes.\n\nA strange sensation came over me, almost like a subtle pulse of energy, as I walked. I looked around to find its source, but there was nothing in sight. I tried focusing on the sensation - eyes closed and mind focused - it was weak, but I could sense it. A feeling that got stronger as I went closer to the source.\n\nI stopped and reached out with my hand, and felt a slight tingle on my fingertips. It was there! But invisible to the naked eye. Is this what the notes referred to? What is this presence? I need to know more.\n\nThis book will be a record of my findings into the field of magic. I dub this book §oArcanum§r.",

Somehow, the world felt different, yet exactly the same as it always has been. Perhaps it was I who has changed? It's absurd that everything could change so much from a single event! ...That's what I would have said to myself, before I decided to delve into this mystery.\n\nEvery being, block, and item is made up of aspects. They are the building blocks of this world. Something simple, like a block of stone, might only be made up of one aspect, but more complex beings or blocks could be made up of many. Currently, I know of 54 aspects that make up this world, and the others.\n\nAspects come in two varieties: Primal and Compound. Primal aspects are the most basic building blocks from which all else is created. There are only six primal aspects: Air, Water, Fire, Earth, Order, and Chaos. Compound aspects are made up of two other aspects. Simple compound aspects might be made from two primals, while more complex ones can be made from two complex aspects, themselves made of several more.\n\nAspects can come in a number of forms. Normally, they're attached to objects, but can be persuaded to to separate into a liquid-like state known as essentia, or purified into a gas-like substance, called vis. The usage of essentia and vis will come in handy for making magical contraptions. (TODO: show aspect combos.)",

First, I'll need some equipment: a crucible and alembic to distill the aspects, a suitably warded jar to contain them, and a tube to transport them.\n\nA crucible can be made by right-clicking a cauldron with a wand, which can be made with a stick and two wand caps, placed diagonally. Wands will come in useful later too.",

My experience using it has taught me something vital about the world: energy is all around me. Energy that can't be seen or felt directly - at least, not at its usual concentration. I have dubbed this energy *vis*, and need to find a proper source of it to do anything more powerful than creating fancy books. Scattered around the world are glowing points in space, which seem to have a higher-than-average concentration of vis. I have designed a set of goggles with which I can view vis, and nodes too, directly.",
    "research.arcana.revealing.stage.2": "While wearing the §oGoggles of Revealing§r, Aura Nodes become immediately observable to me, and interactions between vis and materials become easy to test and iterate on.",

    "research.arcana.tome_of_sharing.stage.1": "It's quite useful to have my knowledge bound to myself, rather than any specific copy of the this book, but it can also be limiting when trying to share my discoveries with friends. Teaching them everything manually is irritating and time-consuming. Perhaps a modified version of this book could teach them instead?",
    "research.arcana.tome_of_sharing.stage.2": "By combining this book with an eye of ender, I can link it to my knowledge specifically, taking advantage of what seems to be similar to the mechanism behind ender chests. Anyone else reading it will gain access to my knowledge.",

    "research.arcana.vis_manipulators.stage.1": "All living things seem to weakly interact with vis in some way, including myself. I intend to take advantage of vis for my own purposes, but to do so, I'll need to figure out how I can manipulate it properly and consistently.",
    "research.arcana.vis_manipulators.stage.2": "Certain materials seem to interact with it in interesting ways. Glass can manipulate it similarly to light, albeit in a more convoluted way; redstone can act as a kind of semiconductor; diamond can concentrate and store it, although I have no way to know how much, yet. Lapis is a kind of fossil fuel for it, capable of releasing a large amount of it (could this be related to enchantment?). Gold, then, is like a superconductor, freely transmitting vis. Finally, iron is resistant to it, absorbing large amounts before showing obserable differences. Wood is a simple, primitive, but abundant vis storage material.\\n\\nMy next task will be creating a tool based on these concepts to properly control vis.",
    "research.arcana.vis_manipulators.stage.3": "The §oVis Manipulation Tools§r are built on the the abilities of diamond, redstone, and glass. With them, I can transfer vis between items capable of containing it - currently just wands - and combine aspects into their compound aspects - that is, if I had anything capable of storing compound aspects. I expect more applications for their use fill appear soon.",

Once every edge aspect is connected, the puzzle is complete.",
