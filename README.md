# Arcana
for Minecraft 1.16.

Arcana is a magic-themed Minecraft mod, and an unofficial successor to Thaumcraft. 

## DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT HAS CEASED DEVELOPMENT.
although feel free to fork the project and tinker with. the code is open-source. although support cannot be offered.

## Opening Arcana 
in its current state Arcana was left very unfinished. So there are a ton of bugs. again support cannot be offered to what there is. but here's how to get it working on your side:

Simply clone the git repo and open `build.gradle` with your IDE of your choice. Run `genIntellijRuns` or `genEclipseRuns` (or VS Code runs for the 1 person who uses that), and restart your IDE to get run configs. (Eclipse users may also need to edit their run configs; check the forge docs.)

In IntelliJ, you may also need to turn off IntelliJ's annotation processing (which Gradle handles), if you get "missing refmap" errors.
Go to Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors -> (in the list) Gradle Imported -> Arcana-1.15.main -> Turn off "Enable annotation processing".
